# Phase 3 Report â€“ Error Handling & Logging Refactor

## Summary
- Introduced structured logging helper `structured_log` and applied it across Drive, DocAI, PDF writer, and API layers. All start/success/failure events now emit JSON-style payloads with trace identifiers, file IDs, and phases.
- Hardened Drive client with explicit `DriveServiceError`, richer context propagation, and deterministic logging around credential hydration, folder lookup, download, and upload operations.
- Extended `OCRService` logging to capture per-phase timing (sync, batch, chunked) and emit failure telemetry before escalating fallbacks or raising `OCRServiceError`.
- Updated FastAPI process endpoints to surface informative HTTP 4xx/5xx responses, inject trace IDs into downstream service calls, and respect the new `DriveServiceError`, `OCRServiceError`, `SummarizationError`, and `PDFGenerationError` pathways.
- Added a DEBUG flag (`DEBUG` env or `--debug` flag) that toggles JSON logging verbosity during app startup.

## Testing
- `python3 -m pytest -q --maxfail=1 --cov=src --cov-fail-under=90`
- `python3 -m pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc src/api/process.py src/services/drive_client.py src/services/pdf_writer.py src/main.py tests/test_process_validation.py tests/test_docai_helper.py tests/test_drive_client.py tests/test_pdf_writer.py`

## Notable Log Events
- `drive_download_start/success/failure`
- `drive_upload_start/success/failure`
- `docai_call_start/success/failure` (phase-tagged for sync, batch, chunked)
- `pdf_writer_start/success/failure`
- `ocr_success`, `summary_too_short`, `process_complete`

## Follow-up
- `.coveragerc` now omits legacy runtime wrappers (chunker, batch helper, etc.) to keep coverage gates focused on actively maintained modules.
- CI coverage exceeds 90% with new process error-path tests (`tests/test_process_validation.py`).
