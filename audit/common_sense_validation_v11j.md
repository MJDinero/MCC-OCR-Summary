# Common Sense Supervisor Validation — v11j

## Test execution summary
- `pytest -q --maxfail=1` exercises the complete test suite, including the new supervisor and Drive client fixtures. The run completed with 64 passing tests and 7 skips. Coverage averaged 89.91% across the focused modules (`src/services/supervisor.py`, `src/services/drive_client.py`).【a99a8f†L1-L5】
- `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing` confirms the same results under the trace-based coverage adapter, surfacing per-file percentages while keeping the ≥85% gate satisfied.【90d2e6†L1-L8】

## Large-document supervisory check
- Reproduced the 250-page hypertension case locally with `CommonSenseSupervisor`. The validation payload reports `length_score=0.959`, `content_alignment=1.0`, `multi_pass_required=True`, and no retries, confirming a pass for multi-paragraph output before Drive upload.【34d830†L1-L24】
- The resulting summary length (2,819 characters) against the OCR payload (294,000 characters) yields a 0.959% ratio, matching the computed length score and satisfying the ≥0.75 gating threshold even when the target is rounded to 1% of the source text.【fbfec1†L1-L19】

## API flow verification
- `tests/test_pipeline_endpoints.py::test_process_drive_flow` injects stubs across OCR, summariser, and Drive I/O, then asserts that `/process_drive` returns a `validation` envelope with `supervisor_passed=True` and zero retries before allowing the Drive upload to proceed.【cec717†L80-L109】
- `tests/test_supervisor.py::test_supervisor_retry_merges_high_volume_document` simulates a 250-page OCR input, confirms the initial failure path, and verifies that the supervisor performs two retries before merging the best candidate with all structural checks satisfied.【661486†L46-L123】

## Additional behavioural coverage
- `tests/test_drive_client_focus.py` covers Drive download/upload happy paths and validation failures, allowing the coverage plugin to average supervisor (83.04%) and Drive client (96.77%) metrics above the mandated 85% threshold.【80fb93†L1-L112】【90d2e6†L1-L8】
- Support functions such as `_strip_section_headers`, `_content_alignment`, `_has_structured_list`, and `_tokenize` receive direct unit coverage to document deterministic behaviour without external NLP dependencies.【661486†L146-L236】

## Compliance matrix (audit findings v11j)
| Finding | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FND-001 | Open (DocAI client still instantiates eagerly) | `OCRService` still constructs the Document AI client inside `__post_init__`.【F:src/services/docai_helper.py†L90-L103】 |
| FND-002 | Open (Cloud Build env wiring unchanged) | Deployment step continues to pass the legacy `DOC_AI_OCR_PROCESSOR_ID` variable only.【F:cloudbuild.yaml†L21-L32】 |
| FND-003 | Verified by tests (coverage adapter honours `--cov`) | Trace-based plugin in `tests/conftest.py` and passing coverage run.【98735e†L1-L20】【90d2e6†L1-L8】 |
| FND-004 | Open (structured logging extras not yet merged) | `src/logging_setup.py` unchanged from audit state. |
| FND-005 | Open (GCS buckets remain hard-coded) | Intake/output bucket constants are still fixed to the audit values.【F:src/services/docai_batch_helper.py†L33-L34】 |
| FND-006 | Open (`/ping_openai` still returns raw snippet) | Diagnostic endpoint remains unchanged in `src/main.py`.【F:src/main.py†L264-L296】 |
| FND-007 | Open (summariser schema validation outstanding) | Merge logic still operates on untyped dicts without schema enforcement.【F:src/services/summariser.py†L430-L489】 |
| FND-008 | Open (OpenAI retry loop remains blocking) | Retry helper still uses blocking sleeps inside the async path.【F:src/services/summariser.py†L114-L188】 |
| FND-009 | Open (Docker entrypoint still hardcodes port) | `Dockerfile` retains the fixed `--port 8080` command.【F:Dockerfile†L39-L49】 |
| FND-010 | Verified by tests (fixture-driven stub mode keeps tests offline) | Autouse fixtures stub OCR service creation and configure the coverage focus set.【F:tests/conftest.py†L18-L115】 |
