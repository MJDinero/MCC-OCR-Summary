  "text": "John D. Carter, a 54-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, presented for a comprehensive follow-up visit. He reported intermittent chest pressure during brisk walking that resolves with rest, along with persistent fatigue over the past month. Vital signs recorded blood pressure at 148/92 mmHg, heart rate 86 bpm, temperature 98.7 F, and oxygen saturation 97 percent on room air. Physical examination revealed mild bilateral ankle edema without calf tenderness, clear lung fields, and a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Laboratory review showed HbA1c of 7.8 percent, LDL cholesterol of 132 mg per dL, and serum creatinine of 1.1 mg per dL with estimated GFR of 72 mL per min. Provider Dr. Amelia Stone discussed risk factor modification and the importance of medication adherence. The patient admitted to occasionally missing evening doses of Lisinopril 20 mg and Metformin 1000 mg due to fatigue.\n\nDr. Stone administered an in-office electrocardiogram that demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes. She ordered an exercise stress test and updated the care plan to include starting Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly while continuing aspirin 81 mg. The patient received counseling on the DASH diet, daily walking with gradual progression to 150 minutes per week, and weight monitoring. Follow-up was scheduled for six weeks to review stress test results and reassess blood pressure control. Education materials regarding recognition of cardiac warning signs and emergency procedures were provided. The visit concluded with documentation of patient understanding and agreement with the plan.",
